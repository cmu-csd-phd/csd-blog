# CMU CSD PhD Blog

This repository holds the source files for the CMU CSD PhD blog,
hosted at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-phd-blog/

## Instructions for the student

1. Make a GitHub account if you don't already have one (in the rest of
   the instructions, this will be referred to as `harrybovik`)
2. Fork this repository (click the fork button on the GitHub
   interface) to your user account. This will make
   `https://github.com/harrybovik/csd-blog`.
3. The rest of these instructions assume you are on Linux or MacOS. If
   you are not on either of these, you can use the Andrew Linux
   machines, or set up a VM, or adapt the instructions to the OS of
   your choice. If you have working instructions for a different OS,
   improvements to these instructions would be appreciated.
4. Clone the repository locally using `git clone
   https://github.com/harrybovik/csd-blog`.
5. Copy the `template.md` file from root of the repository into
   `website/content/YEAR/` where `YEAR` is the current year, and
   modify it as necessary for your blog. If the folder for the current
   year does not exist, make a new folder, copying `_index.md` from
   the previous year into the directory first. The name you give to
   the copied `template.md` should indicate a short name for the
   blogpost, so for example if the title of your blogpost is
   "Underwater Basketweaving: A New Approach to Fast Weaving", an
   ideal filename would be `underwater-basketweaving.md`. This file is
   written in Markdown, and the template shows common uses for most
   supported Markdown. Make sure to read all the instructions given in
   the `template.md` file too. If you require images (or other static
   content) for your blogpost, please make the folder
   `website/static/YEAR/BLOGPOSTNAME` and place the image files in
   it. This will allow you to introduce images in your Markdown file
   directly using `![alttext for foo](./foo.png)`, `![alt text for
   this image](./asdf.jpg)`, etc. Make sure you are using good
   alt-text, necessary for accessibility for visually impaired
   users. If you need help with writing Markdown, please refer to the
   [CommonMark help](https://commonmark.org/help/). If you need to use
   LaTeX in your blogpost, you can use `\\( x^y \\)` for inline LaTeX,
   and `\\[ x^y \\]` or `$$ x^y $$` block-style LaTeX. If you want to
   dive deeper into more advanced stuff you can do, you can look at
   the [documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/) for the
   site generator being used, Zola.
6. Run `./local_server.sh` to build the website and view it
   locally. This will start the local server to serve the website at
   http://127.0.0.1:1111/ (check output of the command if this doesn't
   work). Check this URL in your browser to see if it looks ok. Once
   happy, hit Ctrl-C to stop the local server.
7. Run `./local_build.sh` to produce a zip file, and send over the
   produced `generated-website.zip` to committee members (along with
   the `.md` file, for committee members who prefer that).
8. Wait nervously for reviews, suggestions, comments, criticisms,
   praise, and (hopefully) acceptance to come in. If not accepted,
   make changes, and repeat previous steps until accepted by
   committee.
9. Once accepted, have the committee fill out the blog post approval form,
   and send the form to the Computer Science Department Doctoral
   Program Manager. A blank version of this form can be found at the
   root of the blog repository as `WritingSkillsApprovalForm.pdf`.

10. Update the date to match the date of the last approver signature. This is the date that is entered into DSR as the official completion date for the Skill.
   
12. Commit your changes to your fork of the repository (`git add
    content/YEAR/BLOGPOSTNAME.md`, `git add
    website/static/YEAR/BLOGPOSTNAME` and `git commit -m 'Blogpost by
    Harry Bovik'`) and push changes to GitHub (`git push`).
13. Make a pull request to the official repository by clicking the
    pull request button, adding all requested information.
14. Wait for the web-admin to confirm that everything is on order and
    pull your changes into the main repository.
15. Rejoice!

## Instructions for the committee

You do not need to run anything in this repository if you don't want
to. Instead, you simply receive and look at the email sent by the
student.

1. Receive email from student with the zipped/compressed
   folder. Alternatively, you can read the `.md` file directly from
   the student if you prefer that.
2. Unzip it and look at the student's post's HTML file (can be found
   inside `public/YEAR/POSTNAME/index.html`). Links (currently) within
   the post will point to the main website, not to the local
   copy. This may be fixed in the future if someone has time to update
   the scripts/instructions.
3. Provide reviews to students (via email).
4. Rinse and repeat, until post is acceptable.
5. Fill out blog post approval form. A blank version of this form can
   be found at the root of the blog repository as
   `WritingSkillsApprovalForm.pdf`.

## Instructions for the web-admin

The following steps need to be run (in order) whenever notified by
the Computer Science Department Doctoral Program Manager that a
blog post has been approved:

1. Find the post's corresponding pull request in the repository.
2. Run `./admin_server.sh ID` (where ID is the pull-request number on
   the GitHub interface) to grab a local copy of the student's
   changes, and generate the website on the local machine. This will
   start a local server at http://127.0.0.1:1111/
3. Confirm that the locally generated website looks good (i.e., the
   front page is actually showing the student's new post on top, and
   the link can be clicked on) by visiting the URL with a
   browser. Once satisfied, hit Ctrl-C in the previously running
   command to kill the local server.
4. Merge the changes made by the student on the GitHub web interface,
   so that it is now made permanent in the repository.
5. Run `./admin_build.sh` to pull the authoritative version of the
   repository and build the actual `generated-website.zip` file that
   can then be moved onto AFS and unzipped into the right location.
6. Confirm that the changes are now live (again, just check that the
   new post is visible).

## Technical Information

(Relevant if you are planning on updating the core infrastructure
 around this repository)

+ The exact version of the compiled binary is maintained in
  `./binaries`. If updating to a new version of Zola, the only change
  needed would be to remove the old version in that directory and
  replace it with the new `.tar.gz` and the scripts should
  automatically pick it up.
+ LaTeX rendering performed via KaTeX.
+ The website is hosted via an AFS share at the moment, but since this
  repository works via a site-generator, if the particular web-hosting
  changes, all that would be necessary to change is _where_ the
  produced HTML files are dropped into.
